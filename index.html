								<h2>How it Started<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Shortly after meeting in their hometown of Fairfield, Safiya moved back to Arcata to finish her last year in college.
								By December 2010, the archives of Facebook indicate Safiya Bal and Nick Iriarte were "In a Relationship".
								In May 2011, Nick visited Safiya for the last time in Arcata when she graduated.
								After Safiya's graduation, Nick and Safiya were finally able to be together, back where it all started in their hometown.</p>

								<h2>Over the Years<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Nearly 10 years together have brought them both great joy and excitement.
								In 2012, Nick and Safiya journeyed north, sampling the craft beers of each town along the way, before reaching their final destination, Vancouver, Canada.
								In 2013, their travels brought them beyond the southern border, braving a tropical storm in the Caribbean, where they enjoyed the cantinas of Isla Mujeres, Mexico.
								In 2014, they journed south, stopping at brewery after brewery until they made it San Diego, the craft beer mecca of Southern California.
								Both Nick and Safiya, working hard on their careers, found solace in their countles trips to the Wigwam, in Truckee, which became a second home. 
								For some time, vacations were few and far between, but they made the most of spending time with friends and family locally.
								Whether it was yelling "Hazaa!" at the Northern California Rennaissance Faire, visiting family in Phoenix, AZ, exploring "London" at the Great Dicken's Fair, or simply having brunch with friends, life together was always full of great times.
								After a long hiatus from having a hiatus, in 2018, they were afforded the wonderful opportunity to visit Maui, where they hiked in flip flops, explored the jungle, and laid on the beach. 
								The hard work they put into their careers would eventually pay off.
								After many years bouncing between archaeology field projects, Safiya is now set in a stable position, and Nick grinded his way from being a technician to a Security Engineer.
								In 2019, Nick and Safiya joined the "Homeowner's Club", buying their first home in Richmond, CA.
