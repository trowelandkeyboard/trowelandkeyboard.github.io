								<h2>How it Started<br />
								</h2>
								<p>Shortly after we met in Fairfield, Safiya moved back to Arcata to finish her last year of school. It took nearly six months for us label ourselves.
								By December 2010, we became what was called in those days "facebook official". In May 2011, Nick visited Safiya for the last time in Arcata when she graduated.
								After she finished school, Nick and Safiya were finally able to spend more time together, living in Fairfield.</p>

								<h2>Over the Years<br />
								</h2>
								<p>We've had many wonderful experiences together. Two road trips, one up the west coast to Canada in 2012, and one down the coast to San Diego in 2014.
								In 2013, we went to Isla Mujeres, Mexico. Every year, we go to the Northern California Rennaissance Faire, and even worked there in 2014. 
								Countless trips to the Wigwam in Truckee, and it is essentially our second home. Every Christmas we go to the Dicken's Fair in San Francisco.
								We've gone on several trips to Phoenix to visit Safiya's family and explore the desert. In 2017, we experienced the Wonderful Wizarding World. We chased waterfalls on Maui in 2018.
								We've had our job struggles, but by 2016, we seemed to have it figured out. Nick has climbed the tech ladder and his hard work has finally paid off. Safiya spent years bouncing between archaeology field projects, and has settled into career mode. 
								In 2019, we joined the homeowner's club after we bought our little house in Richmond, California.</p>
